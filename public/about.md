# About Me

As a Masters Student at Cornell University, I am currently engaged in advancing my expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning. My focus areas include deep neural networks, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Data Science. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022.

My professional career includes two years of work experience at IBM as a Data Scientist and Software Developer. In this capacity, I was involved in projects related to data analysis, modeling, visualization, and failure detection and prevention. Additionally, at Code Ocean, a platform facilitating computational reproducibility in research, I contributed to enhancing the platform's batch processing and genomics data analysis capabilities.

I am anticipating graduation in May 2024 and am currently seeking full-time opportunities in New York City in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. My goal is to leverage my skills in AI to generate a positive impact, particularly in areas like healthcare, drug discovery, and various other fields. I am open to discussions regarding job opportunities in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Inteligence.
